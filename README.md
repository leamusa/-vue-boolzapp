- **Replica of the layout**

# Milestone 1

We replicated the design, allowing messages sent by the user to appear in green and messages from the interlocutor to appear in white, assigning two different CSS classes.

- **Dynamic display of contact list**
  Using the v-for directive, we dynamically display the name and image of each contact.

# Milestone 2

- **Dynamic display of messages**
  Using the v-for directive, we display all messages related to the active contact within the conversation panel.
- **Clicking on a contact shows the conversation**: When a contact is clicked, the conversation of the clicked contact is displayed.

# Milestone 3

- **Adding a message**: The user writes a message in the bottom part, and upon pressing "enter", the message is added to the thread above as a green message.
- **Response from the interlocutor**: With each message insertion, the user receives an "ok" as a response, which appears after 1 second.

# Milestone 4

- **User search**
  By typing something in the input on the left, only contacts whose name contains the entered letters are displayed (e.g., Marco, Matteo, Martina -> Typing "mar" will show only Marco and Martina).

# Milestone 5 (optional)

- **Delete message**
  Clicking on a message displays a dropdown menu that allows deleting the selected message.
- **Display time and last sent/received message in contact list**
  Displaying the time and the last message sent/received in the contact list view.
